<h3 id="left-of-me">Left of me</h3>

<p>“How will you pay?”</p>

<p>Another meal has to be paid. With nothing of value left, what can I do?</p>

<p>“How much can I get for one eyeball?”</p>

<p>“One eyeball is worth one week. You know that, Alfa9213. But since you allready have given away your left eye, you will not be able to work. How about one of your arms? We have a request from planet Omega for a left arm. That will get you a fortnight worth of meals.”</p>

<p>“But I’m left handed. It will be akward for me to adapt to using my right arm.”</p>

<p>“You are hungry? Are you not?”</p>

<p>I’ve been feeling hungry for as long as I can remember. And its been 3 days since our last meal. So I say ok. Being crippled is not a strange thing here on planet Alfa. Ever since that day I’ve felt a little lopsided when they took whats <em>Left of me</em>.</p>

<h3 id="anyone-will-do">Anyone will do</h3>

<p>“How will you pay?”</p>

<p>Another meal has to be paid. With nothing of value with me what can I do?</p>

<p>“How much can I get for my dog?”</p>

<p>“There is no demand for dogs, as you should know. You tried that last week. However one of your twin daughters is worth a whole month of meals. There’s a request from planet Omega for a baby girl.”</p>

<p>“But they are the best that’s happened to me.”</p>

<p>“You are hungry? Are you not?”</p>

<p>I’ve been feeling hungry for as long as I can remember. And its been 3 days since our last meal. So I say ok. One less mouth to feed is a little bit easier to handle. Specially since working with one arm and one eye is not bringing more food on the table. So I guess <em>Anyone will do</em>.</p>

<h3 id="ill-buy">I’ll buy</h3>

<p>“How will you pay?”</p>

<p>Another meal has to be paid. With nothing of value on me what can I do?</p>

<p>“How much can I get for my deck of cards?”</p>

<p>“There is no demand for a deck of cards! This is getting tiresome. You’ve tried that the three past days. How about that gold watch you’ve got under your shirt?”</p>

<p>“Who told you about that? No I will not give give up my gold watch. It’s my only family heirloom.”</p>

<p>“You are hungry? Are you not?”</p>

<p>I’ve been feeling hungry for as long as I can remember. And its been 3 days since my last meal. So I say ok. I can’t eat gold as far as I know and I do liked to wear my gold watch on my missing left arm.</p>

<h3 id="who-cares">Who cares?</h3>

<p>“How will you pay?”</p>

<p>Another meal has to be paid. With nothing of value in sight what can I do?</p>

<p>“How much can I get for my hut?”</p>

<p>“There is no demand on planet Omega for a run down hut on planet Alfa, as you should know by NOW!”</p>

<p>The robot screamed out the last word.</p>

<p>“How about your soul? Since you are the only human left on your pathetic little planet.”</p>

<p>My whole body screamed with rage, regret, sorrow. Now that the robot has stated the obvious, I have felt a little bit lonely lately.</p>

<p>“I give you my soul if you will tell me the truth behind all of this?”</p>

<p>The robot goes silent, clearly communicating with the home planet.</p>

<p>“Ok, the truth, but I still get your soul.”</p>

<p>“But don’t I need my soul?”</p>

<p>“You are hungry? Are you not?”</p>

<p>I’ve been feeling hungry for as long as I can remember. And its been 3 days since my last meal. So I say OK. Being alone here on this planet would be easier to handle without a soul, I’m sure.</p>

<p>I’m feeling content with food in my body. Then the robot show me the truth. That it is all a lie. Behind the robot there’s a curtain and behind the curtain is a large gathering of people watching the show, me, on a gigantic screen. I learn that everybody, humans and robots, thrive right here on Earth. Before the robot take my soul away he tells me:</p>

<p>“The rich and famous were taking bets on you going the distance. My master made a fortune on you. If you look closely to the left on the podium you can see the fake
family we provided for you.”</p>

<p>“What about my left arm? Left leg?”</p>

<p>“Oh that? I fed that to my masters dog.”</p>

<p>And when the soul slowly seep out of my body, I realize that I cannot live without a soul. A single thought run thru my mind when darkness comes:</p>

<p>“Who cares.”</p>

<p>The End</p>
